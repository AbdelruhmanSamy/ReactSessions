# Task Session 1
## Before starting in the project
- It's recommended to watch this video:[React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)
- Search about how to use "axios"
## For the project
1. At the begining there will be nothing working, so it's okay.
2. search for todos in all files (even in css ones) of the project and resolve them.
