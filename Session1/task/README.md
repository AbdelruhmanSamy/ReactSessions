# Task Session 1
## Before starting in the project
- It's recommended to watch this video: [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)
- Search about how to use "axios"
## For the project
1. To start the project clone it and run the following commands:
```bash 
    cd task
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
2. At the begining there will be nothing working, so it's okay.
3. search for todos in all files (even in css ones) of the project and resolve them.
